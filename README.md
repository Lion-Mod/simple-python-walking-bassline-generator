# A simple Python walking bassline generator
This is a simple Jupyter notebook showing a way to generate a walking bassline given a major key for X number of bars.

Given walking basslines tend to have a somewhat formulaic method of creating them it can be implemented in code fairly easily. It's not to say this will be bringing down the house at the local _jazz_ club but it may be useful to generate practice lines.
